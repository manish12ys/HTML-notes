## 🌱 **2. HTML 2.0 (1995)**  
- Published by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**.  
- Added support for forms, tables, and more complex formatting.  
- Became the first official HTML specification.

## 🌐 **4. HTML 4.01 (1999)**  
- Introduced CSS for better styling and separation of content and design.  
- Improved support for scripting and multimedia elements.  
- Introduced `iframe` for embedding content.
